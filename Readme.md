###For developers a little inside on the wave generation:

Every ten miliseconds a the attacking wave is regenerated with an array of cannon objects
Each cannon object is rendered after looping through all the created cannons.  if a cannon falls of the bottom of the screen or collides with the shield it is removed from the array and will never be rendered again.

Below is a code snippet to demonstrate the recreation of each cannon on each frame being rendered: 

`
drawAttackingWave(guardianShield, myScoring) {
  for (let i = this.cannons.length-1; i >=0 ; i--) {
    this.cannons[i].moveCannon(guardianShield, myScoring);
    if (this.cannons[i].status === 1) {
      this.cannons[i].drawCannon();
    }
    if (this.cannons[i].status < 0 && this.cannons[i].status > -5 ){ //cannon to explode on shield
      this.cannons[i].blockedExplosion();
      this.cannons[i].status += 1;
    }
    if (this.cannons[i].status === 0){ // status === 0 , remove cannon
      this.cannons.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
}
